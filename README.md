# MuraTOC

A display object dynamically generating a table of contents based on the heading elements (h2, h3, ...) in the page, without changing the page contents.

It has the following parameters on top of the default ones: title, list type and maximum depth.

The table of contents is enclosed in a div with the class `pageTOC`, which can be used for styling in a theme.

To install, simply copy the toc folder in the theme's `display_objects` folder and reload the application.
